Prior-data disagreement occurs when the researcher’s prior knowledge is not in agreement with the evidence provided by the data. We examined the ability of the Data Agreement Criterion (DAC) and Bayes Factor (BF) to detect prior-data disagreement in SEM through a simulation study. The design included four sample size levels and 49 prior specifications. Findings suggested that prior-data disagreement still affects posterior estimates when samples are relatively large. Further, comparing multiple prior specifications sheds more light on the presence of prior-data disagreement than assessing a single prior specification. The DAC was easy to implement but cannot assess interactions between priors within one specification. The BF takes these interactions into account, resulting in a global assessment of prior-data disagreement. However, the BF became challenging to compute with larger sample sizes. Implications for applied researchers are discussed.","tags":["Bayesian estimation","prior-data disagreement","prior distributions","structural equation models"],"title":"Detecting Prior-Data Disagreement in Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sonja D.

Research has identified academic self-efficacy, optimism, goal orientation, and academic stress all as psychological factors associated with academic performance. However, this research rarely distinguishes between first- and continuing-generation students, and there may be unique effects for each group. We investigated whether the previously identified psychological factors associated with academic performance hold the same relationships for firstand continuing-generation college students. A sample of 143 undergraduate students self-reported levels of academic self-efficacy, optimism, goal orientation, and academic stress. Academic performance was measured using their midterm exam grade. There were differences found in the mean levels of psychological factors and their associations with academic performance for first- and continuing-generation students. Overall, the psychological factors explained a very small portion of the variance in academic performance among first-generation students (13.4%) with none of the psychological factors holding an independent association with academic performance. Conversely, psychological factors explained considerably more of the variance in academic performance for continuing-generation students (60.5%), with domains of goal orientation and academic stress being independently associated with academic performance. Our findings suggest that new pathways to improving first-generation students’ academic performance should be identified, and that the current literature knows very little about the psychological factors that play a role in their academic performance.","tags":null,"title":"Illuminating Differences in The Psychological Predictors of Academic Performance for First- And Continuing-Generation Students","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sonja D.

Many popular software programs offer default prior distributions, which is helpful for novel users and makes Bayesian SEM accessible for a broad audience. However, when the sample size is small, those prior distributions are not always suitable and can lead to untrustworthy results. In this tutorial, we provide a non-technical discussion of the risks associated with the use of default priors in small sample contexts. We discuss how default priors can unintentionally behave as highly informative priors when samples are small. Also, we demonstrate an online educational Shiny app, in which users can explore the impact of varying prior distributions and sample sizes on model results. We discuss how the Shiny app can be used in teaching; provide a reading list with literature on how to specify suitable prior distributions; and discuss guidelines on how to recognize (mis)behaving priors. It is our hope that this tutorial helps to spread awareness of the importance of specifying suitable priors when Bayesian SEM is used with small samples.","tags":null,"title":"Dangers of the Defaults: A Tutorial on the Impact of Default Priors When Using Bayesian SEM With Small Samples","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sarah Depaoli","Sonja D.

In this paper, we discuss the importance of examining prior distributions through a sensitivity analysis. We argue that conducting a prior sensitivity analysis is equally important when so-called diffuse priors are implemented as it is with subjective priors. As a proof of concept, we conducted a small simulation study, which illustrates the impact of priors on final model estimates. The findings from the simulation study highlight the importance of conducting a sensitivity analysis of priors. This concept is further extended through an interactive Shiny App that we developed. The Shiny App allows users to explore the impact of various forms of priors using empirical data. We introduce this Shiny App and thoroughly detail an example using a simple multiple regression model that users at all levels can understand. In this paper, we highlight how to determine the different settings for a prior sensitivity analysis, how to visually and statistically compare results obtained in the sensitivity analysis, and how to display findings and write up disparate results obtained across the sensitivity analysis. The goal is that novice users can follow the process outlined here and work within the interactive Shiny App to gain a deeper understanding of the role of prior distributions and the importance of a sensitivity analysis when implementing Bayesian methods. The intended audience is broad (e.g., undergraduate or graduate students, faculty, and other researchers) and can include those with limited exposure to Bayesian methods or the specific model presented here.","tags":null,"title":"The Importance of Prior Sensitivity Analysis in Bayesian Statistics: Demonstrations Using an Interactive Shiny App","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sonja D.

This feature adds flexibility in handling non-normality in longitudinal data, through manifest or latent variables, by directly modeling skewed or heavy-tailed latent classes rather than assuming a mixture of normal distributions. The aim of this study was to assess through simulation the potential under- or over-extraction of latent classes in a growth mixture model when underlying data follow either normal, skewed-normal, or skewed-t distributions. In order to assess this, we implement skewed-t, skewed-normal, and conventional normal (i.e., not skewed) forms of the growth mixture model. The skewed-t and skewed-normal versions of this model have only recently been implemented, and relatively little is known about their performance. Model comparison, fit, and classification of correctly specified and mis-specified models were assessed through various indices. Findings suggest that the accuracy of model comparison and fit measures are dependent on the type of (mis)specification, as well as the amount of class separation between the latent classes. A secondary simulation exposed computation and accuracy difficulties under some skewed modeling contexts. Implications of findings, recommendations for applied researchers, and future directions are discussed; a motivating example is presented using education data.","tags":null,"title":"Implementing Continuous Non-Normal Skewed Distributions in Latent Growth Mixture Modeling: An Assessment of Specification Errors and Class Enumeration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Johan F.

The robot was not seen as affectively distant but rather involving, ethical, skilled, and people wanted to consult her again. Note that doctor robot was not a seriously looking physician but a little girl with the voice of a young woman. We conclude that both Media Equation and CASA need to be altered when it comes to robot communication.

Thus, the current study examined if the CushingQoL is interpreted in the same way across nationalities. Methods: Patients from the U.S. (n = 260) and the Netherlands (n = 103) were asked to fill out the CushingQoL and a short demographics survey. Measurement invariance testing was utilized to explore whether or not the patient samples from the U.S. and the Netherlands interpreted items on the CushingQoL in the same way. Results: A two-subscale scoring approach was used for the CushingQoL. Model fit was good for the U.S. sample (e.g., CFI = 0.983; TLI = 0.979), as well as the Dutch sample (e.g., CFI = 0.971; TLI = 0.964). Invariance testing revealed that three of the 12 items on the CushingQoL were interpreted differently across the groups. These items are all related to psychosocial issues (e.g., irritable mood and worrying about one's health). Items assessing physical aspects of QoL did not vary across the U.S. and Dutch samples.

This process might be especially useful in the context of latent growth mixture modeling when one or more of the latent groups are expected to be relatively small due to what we refer to as limited data. We argue that the use of Bayesian statistics has great advantages in limited data situations, but only if background knowledge can be incorporated into the analysis via prior distributions. We highlight these advantages through a data set including patients with burn injuries and analyze trajectories of posttraumatic stress symptoms using the Bayesian framework following the steps of the WAMBS-checklist. In the included example, we illustrate how to obtain background information using previous literature based on a systematic literature search and by using expert knowledge. Finally, we show how to translate this knowledge into prior distributions and we illustrate the importance of conducting a prior sensitivity analysis. Although our example is from the trauma field, the techniques we illustrate can be applied to any field.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian PTSD-Trajectory Analysis with Informed Priors Based on a Systematic Literature Search and Expert Elicitation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jitske Tiemensma","Sarah Depaoli","Sonja D.

Enrollment rates of Latinos at universities is increasing. Research has indicated that youths are more susceptible to trauma, particularly Latinos. Thus, it is imperative to evaluate the validity of commonly used posttraumatic stress measures among Latino college students. The Impact of Event Scale- Revised (IES-R) is one of the most commonly used metrics of posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology. However, it is largely unknown if the IES-R is measuring the same construct across different sub-samples (e.g. Latino versus non-Latino). The current study aimed to assess measurement invariance for the IES-R between Latino and non-Latino participants. A total of 545 participants completed the IES-R. One- and three-factor scoring solutions were compared using confirmatory factor analyses. Measurement invariance was then evaluated by estimating several multiple-group confirmatory factor analytic models. Four models with an increasing degree of invariance across groups were compared. A significant $χ$ 2 difference test was used to indicate a significant change in model fit between nested models within the measurement invariance testing process. The three-factor scoring solution could not be used for the measurement invariance process because the subscale correlations were too high for estimation (rs 0.92-1.00). Therefore, the one-factor model was used for the invariance testing process. Invariance was met for each level of invariance: Configural, metric, scalar, and strict. All measurement invariance testing results indicated that the one-factor solution for the IES-R was equivalent for the Latino and non-Latino participants.","tags":null,"title":"The performance of the IES-R for Latinos and non-Latinos: Assessing measurement invariance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rens van de Schoot","Sonja D.

In the current article, we investigated this claim by performing the very first systematic review of Bayesian psychological articles published between 1990 and 2015 (n = 1,579). We aim to provide a thorough presentation of the role Bayesian statistics plays in psychology. This historical assessment allows us to identify trends and see how Bayesian methods have been integrated into psychological research in the context of different statistical frameworks (e.g., hypothesis testing, cognitive models, IRT, SEM, etc.). We also describe take-home messages and provide “big-picture” recommendations to the field as Bayesian statistics becomes more popular. Our review indicated that Bayesian statistics is used in a variety of contexts across subfields of psychology and related disciplines. There are many different reasons why one might choose to use Bayes (e.g., the use of priors, estimating otherwise intractable models, modeling uncertainty, etc.). We found in this review that the use of Bayes has increased and broadened in the sense that this methodology can be used in a flexible manner to tackle many different forms of questions. We hope this presentation opens the door for a larger discussion regarding the current state of Bayesian statistics, as well as future trends.","tags":null,"title":"A Systematic Review of Bayesian Articles in Psychology: The Last 25 Years.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rens van de Schoot","Marit Sijbrandij","Sonja D.

This has led to a wide variety in how results of latent trajectory analysis are reported. To overcome this issue, using a 4-round Delphi study, we developed Guidelines for Reporting on Latent Trajectory Studies (GRoLTS). The purpose of GRoLTS is to present criteria that should be included when reporting the results of latent trajectory analysis across research fields. We have gone through a systematic process to identify key components that, according to a panel of experts, are necessary when reporting results for trajectory studies. We applied GRoLTS to 38 papers where LGMM or LCGA was used to study trajectories of posttraumatic stress after a traumatic event.","tags":null,"title":"The GRoLTS-Checklist: Guidelines for Reporting on Latent Trajectory Studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elly A.

An alternative approach through Bayesian statistics provides various degrees of support for any hypothesis allowing balanced decisions and proper null hypothesis testing, which may prevent publication bias. Testing a null hypothesis becomes increasingly relevant in mediated communication and virtual environments. To illustrate our arguments, we re-analyzed three data sets of previously published data --media violence effects, mediated communication, and visuospatial abilities across genders. Results are discussed in view of possible Bayesian interpretations, which are more open to a content-related argumentation of varying levels of support. Finally, we discuss potential pitfalls of a Bayesian approach such as BF-hacking (cf., “God would love a Bayes Factor of 3.01 nearly as much as a BF of 2.99”). Especially when BF values are small, replication studies and Bayesian updating are still necessary to draw conclusions.","tags":null,"title":"Possible Solution to Publication Bias Through Bayesian Statistics, Including Proper Null Hypothesis Testing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://winterstat.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
